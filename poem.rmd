## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Five little girls of Five, Four, Three, Two, One:  
Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun.  
Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:  
Sitting down to lessons--no more time for tricks.  
Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:  
Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

I have been one acquainted with the night.  
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.  
I have outwalked the furthest city light.  
I have looked down the saddest city lane.  
I have passed by the watchman on his beat. 
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make. 
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was. 
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun. 
Had got no business to be there. 
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the cloak of darkness, shadows entwine,  
The moon ascends, a celestial sign.  
A tapestry woven with stars so bright,  
Unveiling secrets in the still of night.  

Soft whispers rustle through ebony air,  
Mysteries whispered with utmost care.  
The world grows silent, a hushed refrain,  
As midnight's symphony takes its reign.  

The night unfolds, a canvas unbound,  
Where dreams take flight, without a sound.  
A nocturnal dance, a mystic ballet,  
As moonbeams pirouette along the way.  

The night sky weaves tales of love and loss,  
A tapestry of memories, a poet's gloss.  
In silken darkness, passions ignite,  
Embracing secrets hidden from daylight.  

The gentle breeze carries a lullaby,  
Serenading creatures, beneath the sky.  
A cradle of solace, where worries subside,  
In the tender arms of the eventide.

## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Five little girls of Five, Four, Three, Two, One:  
Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun.  
Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:  
Sitting down to lessons--no more time for tricks.  
Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:  
Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven!

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the cloak of darkness, shadows entwine,  
The moon ascends, a celestial sign.  
A tapestry woven with stars so bright,  
Unveiling secrets in the still of night.  

Soft whispers rustle through ebony air,  
Mysteries whispered with utmost care.  
The world grows silent, a hushed refrain,  
As midnight's symphony takes its reign.  

The night unfolds, a canvas unbound,  
Where dreams take flight, without a sound.  
A nocturnal dance, a mystic ballet,  
As moonbeams pirouette along the way.  

The night sky weaves tales of love and loss,  
A tapestry of memories, a poet's gloss.  
In silken darkness, passions ignite,  
Embracing secrets hidden from daylight.  

The gentle breeze carries a lullaby,  
Serenading creatures, beneath the sky.  
A cradle of solace, where worries subside,  
In the tender arms of the eventide.
